What are target groups in AWS?
A target group tells a load balancer where to direct traffic to : EC2 instances,
 fixed IP addresses; or AWS Lambda functions, amongst others. 

When creating a load balancer, you create one or more listeners
 and configure listener rules to direct the traffic to one target group.
