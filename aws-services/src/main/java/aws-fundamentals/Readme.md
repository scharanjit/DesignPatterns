Subnets are the local networks inside a VPC
There is always one active route per VPC.
Route allows traffic b/w different nodes in a VPC network.
but it does not allow traffic outside to the network
such as Internet



Internet Gateway is a virtual router that allows the 
VPC to connect to the internet.
