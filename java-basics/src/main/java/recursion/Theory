What is Recursion?
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion


How memory is allocated to different function calls in recursion?
When any function is called from main(), the memory is allocated to
it on the stack. A recursive function calls itself,
the memory for a called function is allocated on top of memory allocated
to calling function and different copy of local variables is created for
each function call. When the base case is reached, the function returns its
 value to the function by whom it is called and memory is de-allocated and
 the process continues.
