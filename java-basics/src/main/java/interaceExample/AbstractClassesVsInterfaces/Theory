With the introduction of default methods in interfaces,

>>it seems that the abstract classes are same as interface in java 8.

>> However this is not entirely true,

>> abstract class can have constructor while in interfaces we canâ€™t have constructors.

>> The purpose of interface is to provide full abstraction,
 while the purpose of abstract class is to provide partial abstraction.

>> Abstract class can contain non-static, non-final members and
   attributes (protected, private in addition to public)
