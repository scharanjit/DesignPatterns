Problem Statement :- A java class with 100 attributes. 5 attributes define
uniqueness of object. How will you find unique object ?

Solution :- Use equal and hashcode method

If two objects are considered equal, their hashcodes must also be equal

You must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals().


Suppose, class Employee has 100 attributes and name and age define uniqueness
