>> HashMap does not call hashcode when null is passed as key
and null Key is handled as special case.

>> HashMap puts null key in bucket 0 and maps null as key to passed value.

>> HashMap does it by linked list (balanced tree in Java 1.8) data structure.

>> HashMap uses linked list  (balanced tree in Java 1.8) data structure internally.

>> While in Hashmap get method the checks if key is passed as null.

Search Value for null key in bucket 0.

Hence there can only be one null key in one hashmap object.
