When to use LinkedList and when to use ArrayList?
1) As explained above the insert and remove operations
give good performance (O(1)) in LinkedList compared to ArrayList(O(n)).
 Hence if there is a requirement of frequent addition and deletion
 in application then LinkedList is a best choice.

2) Search (get method) operations are fast in Arraylist (O(1))
but not in LinkedList (O(n)) so If there are less add and remove
 operations and more search operations requirement, ArrayList would
 be your best bet.
