Testability
Scalability
Maintainability
Reduce Code Complexity
Business Focus

how it works ?
>> Everything in spring is a simple POJO
>> Spring itself can be act as a glorifies hashmap. (It's actually called application context)
>> The application context is a configured Spring container with all of the dependencies wired
up in it.

>> It;s not just creating a hashmap and shoving object in it

>> It can be used as registery and has wiring
