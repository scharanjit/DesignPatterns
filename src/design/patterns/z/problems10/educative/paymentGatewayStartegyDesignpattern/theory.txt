Strategy Design Pattern Important Points

We could have used composition to create instance variable for
 strategies but we should avoid that as we want the specific strategy
 to be applied for a particular task. Same is followed in Collections.sort()
 and Arrays.sort() method that take comparator as argument.

Strategy Pattern is very similar to State Pattern. One of the difference
 is that Context contains state as instance variable and there can be
 multiple tasks whose implementation can be dependent on the state whereas
 in strategy pattern strategy is passed as argument to the method and context
 object does nâ€™t have any variable to store it.

Strategy pattern is useful when we have multiple algorithms for specific
task and we want our application to be flexible to chose any of the algorithm
at runtime for specific task.
