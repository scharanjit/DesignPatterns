//TypeAheadSuggestion :- For TypeAheadSuggestion , we can use Trie
// a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree
// (as they can be searched by prefixes), is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered
// tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array
// where the keys are usually strings.

//trie is basically a pre fix based search !!
// we can do same thing with HashTable but HashTable can not do prefix based search
//Also regular hashtable takes more space than a trie

public class TypeAheadSuggestion {

    //refer Trie
