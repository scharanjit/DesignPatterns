MongoDB is cross-platform and represents its documents in a binary-encoded JSON
 format called BSON (Binary JSON).

 The lightweight binary format adds speed to the flexibility of the
  JSON format, along with more data types. Fields inside MongoDB documents can be indexed.

  MongoDB ensures high availability thanks to its replication mechanisms,
   horizontal scalability allowed by sharding, and is currently the most
    widely adopted document store.
