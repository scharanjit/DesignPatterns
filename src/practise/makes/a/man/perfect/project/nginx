Engine Ex

It serves 3 main features

1.)Load balancing (front end http server ==> balance incoming request)
1000 request ==>EngineX ==>300 1 server
                        ==> 300 2nd Server
                        ==> 400 3rd Server

                        Load on single server be distributed

2.)Caching
 In webapps , we have CSS,JS & Images (which are changed very often)
 we can cache them into ingnx caching to respond back to static resouces
 Page will load faster

3.)Reverse Proxy
Suppose u hav multiple apps
U can run only app on port 80
u can't run other app on port 80

One way is assign different ports to each app
app1.com:80
app2.com:81
app3.com:82

Or we can put ingnx==
Engine X transfer the request to that particular port.

Client need not to worry about port
