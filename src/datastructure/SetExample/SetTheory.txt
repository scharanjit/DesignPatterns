Characteristics of a Set collection:
The following characteristics differentiate a Set collection from others
 in the Java Collections framework:
Duplicate elements are not allowed.
Elements are not stored in order. That means you cannot expect elements
 sorted in any order when iterating over elements of a Set.

Set:- Interface


implementation
1.)HashSet   -->Class   ==> No Duplicates,No order, NO Synchronization
if we need synchronization
  Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));
  otherwise Iterator throws a ConcurrentModificationException

   Default initial capacity is 16 and default load factor is 0.75.
   Number of buckets will be automatically increased if the current size gets full.

                 Number of stored elements in the table
      load factor = -----------------------------------------
                           Size of the hash table

  How HashSet internally work?
  All the classes of Set interface internally backed up by Map. HashSet uses HashMap for storing its object internally. You must be wondering that to enter a value in HashMap we need a key-value pair, but in HashSet we are passing only one value.

  Then how is it storing in HashMap?
  Actually the value we insert in HashSet acts as key to the map Object and for its value java uses a constant variable. So in key-value pair all the keys will have same value.



                       add      contains next     notes
  HashSet               O(1)     O(1)     O(h/n)   h is the table capacity
  LinkedHashSet         O(1)     O(1)     O(1) 
  TreeSet               O(log n) O(log n) O(log n)


2.)LinkedHashSet -->Class  ==> no duplicates, maintain insertion order
3.)Tree Set  -->Class  ==> no duplicates, automatic sort therefore class cast exception
means string tree set me if we added number, it will throw exception
==> null not allowed
