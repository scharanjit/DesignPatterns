Queue:- FIFO

It is an interface, we need a concrete class during its declaration.
There are many ways to initialize a Queue object, most common being-

1.) As a Priority Queue
2.) As a LinkedList


Important points about Priority Queue:

PriorityQueue doesn’t allow null
We can’t create PriorityQueue of Objects that are non-comparable

The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering,
 or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which
 constructor is used.

The head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering.
 If multiple elements are tied for least value, the head is one of those
 elements — ties are broken arbitrarily.

The queue retrieval operations poll, remove, peek, and element access
the element at the head of the queue.

It inherits methods from AbstractQueue, AbstractCollection, Collection
and Object class.
