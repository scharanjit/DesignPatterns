Hash Table supports following operation in O(1) times
1. Search
2. Insert
3. Delete

For a Self balancing BST , the time complexity for these operations is
O(logn)


Advantage of BST over HashTable:-

1.) Can get all keys in  sorted order by just doing Inorder Traversal

2.) Doing order statistics , finding closet  lower and  greater elements ,
doing range queries are easy to do with BST's

3.) BST are easy to implement than traversing
