/*
        Java.util.HashMap class is a Hashing based implementation.
        In HashMap, we have a key and a value pair.
Even though the object is specified as key in hashmap, it does not have
 any reference and it is not eligible for garbage collection if it is
 associated with HashMap i.e. HashMap dominates over Garbage Collector.



 WeakHashMap is an implementation of the Map interface.
  WeakHashMap is almost same as HashMap except in case of WeakHashMap,
  if object is specified as key doesnâ€™t contain any references-
  it is eligible for garbage collection even though it is associated with WeakHashMap.
  i.e Garbage Collector dominates over WeakHashMap.
