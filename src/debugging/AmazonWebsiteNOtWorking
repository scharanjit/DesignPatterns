1) Check if traffic has increased. Is it normal/expected
increase (say Diwali festival season) or unexpected.
If it it is unexpected then analyze further if there is any
suspicious from particular geographical area, phishing attack etc.

2) Check Server performance; any application server crashes ;
memory issues observed

3) Check Database performance; DB server outage; memory issue;
network connectivity issue.
If particular operation is taking long time to process then need to
fine tune queries.

4) Overall network performance. Any outage; increased latency etc.
