 A Desktop Java application which was working till yesterday
 crashes today --- no help from Java debugger.
 How do u go about debugging this?
 *
 *
 * 1- how about enabling java console and run the app again,
 * then see what console says on application crash.
 2- Checking the application logs (if available).
 3- Checking java environment (including path, CLASS_PATH etc) for possible issues.
 *
 *
 * Look for memory error, leak, overshooting of CPU usage,
 * unsufficient RAM or low disk space type of problems if this is related to memory.
