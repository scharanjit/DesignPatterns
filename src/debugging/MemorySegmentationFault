What happens when you get a segmentation fault? how do you get it
 and how is it implemented?

Memory segmentation is the division of a computer's primary memory into
 segments or sections. In a computer system using segmentation, a reference
  to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an
  offset (memory location) within that segment.

Most like the segmentation fault is caused by memory illegal access.
 So probably a good place to check is the place where you dynamically
  allocated/used the memory. Also if it is possible, try to use assert
  in the places where it might go wrong.
