I have clicked some photos in a Camera. I am trying to transfer photos
to laptop using USB cable but the Camera is not getting connected.
 Give debugging steps.

 1. Check if the driver for your camera device is installed properly on machine.
 2. Check system error messages if any logged after connecting the device.
 3. Check cable, ports or hardware related issues if any.
