There is alarm in a mobile and mobile is switched off when alarm is set.
 how to debug this situation? write all the scenarios u approach to debug
 this issue??

 This can be solved in logical manner , there are 3 parameters we can consider
 1. Mobile Alarm
 2. Mobile On / Off State
 3. Mobile Current Time

 When all 3 parameters satisfy the Alarm will ring in all other cases it should fail.
