 * When trying to send a SMS from a mobile if it fails?
 * How do you debug or troubleshoot this problem?


 Solution
 1. Please double-check the phone number entered for any mis-keyed numbers.

 2. Is your phone within service range?

 3. If you have a strong signal, does your cell phone service plan include
 SMS text messaging? Not all cell phone plans include text messaging or you may
 have opted-out of that service option, so you may need to contact your
 service provider to add text messaging service to your plan.

 4. You may not have a compatible texting plan.

 5. Due to mergers between wireless carriers, be sure to select the working
 option in the drop down menu of choices. For examplewithoutbridge, if you do not receive
 messages when AT&T is selected, then try the option listed as AT&T (Legacy).

 6. Have you set up a personal firewall on your mobile device to block
 unknown senders of messages?

 7. Some wireless providers will not deliver text messages if your cell
 phone bill is not paid in full. If you have payments outstanding, you may be
 able to receive phone calls, but not text messages until your account is in
 good standing.

 8. Try sending the message from different mobile.

 9. Remove the Current SIM and try with Another SIM

 10. Try to send message from Different service Provider.
