What happens when you type a link in any browser and click GO button?
 List all steps.

What should be the issue if the browser app build that i have today is
1 second 250 milliseconds slower than yesterday's build?

ASSUME: WiFi is perfect, loading 10 webpages from a controlled server
 - hence there are no infrastructure or server side delays causing this.

What would you think might be the issue? How would you debug?

1)Browser contacts the DNS for the ipAddress
2)DNS returns the IP address
3)Browser establishes a TCP/IP connection with the IP address
4) Browser starts rendering the code



Programmatically these are the approaches that I would take.
1. Test it on multiple browsers and check if the behavior(delay) is same or
occurring only particular browser.
2. use the time collected from past few weeks and observe for any patterns.
3. Write some complete end to end integration/regression test cases.
4. Rely on some unit tests that are written for the code developed
from yesterday to today.
5. see if there are any data structures in the back end are changed.
6. see if the datasource/database queries are changed.
7.) Clear Cache
