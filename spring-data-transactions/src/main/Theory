Transaction:- A series of action that is treated as single unit of work
is considered as transaction


For Example Buy a ticket and reserve a seat (either both should pass or both should fail)



Transaction should follow ACID

Atomicity :- A transaction should happen complete or either it should not happen at all.
No mid or half committed.


Consistency :- A transaction is committed only when all actions are completed. Data
remains consistent

Isolation :- One transaction should be isolated from another transaction. 1 transaction cannot
read data from another transaction. they should be completely isolated

Durability :- A transaction is durable when it cannot be undone by system failure.It saves
in persistent storage.



Transaction management ensures data consistency and integrity.


Transaction types :-

Global :- Multiple resources manage the transaction (MQs + RDBs)


Local :- One resource manage the transaction (JDBC connection)


Transaction Management Types

Programmatic :- Developers write custom code to manage the transaction and set boundaries

Declarative :- Developer separates transaction management from business code


Isolation levels
Default :- Default from underlying database
