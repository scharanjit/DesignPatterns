Elastic Search

Document  ==> Indexes

sharding
Shard A Shard B
Replication
 Replica A Replica B

 Node

Each data row in elastic search is called document
Each document in es is equivalent to data in a row of sql db.

===>

In elasticsearch,

Each ES clusters , consist of 1 or more nodes,
data is stored on shards
Shards are stored on nodes.


 ====
 Sharing allows es to store number of documents and index can be stored in multiple nodes,
 by splitting indexes into smaller pieces.

 img 1,2,3,4 represent creation of index pages
 state changes from gree to yellow
 because it has one replica, which is unsassigned
 as the es is running in single node

 it does not make sense to have single node, and having replica in same node

 what if whole node failed, replica too would be lost.

 Minimum two nodes are required
