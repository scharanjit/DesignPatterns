Fist level cache in hibernate is enabled by default.
It is associated with Session object.
It is lost, once the session is closed.
It is not accessible to any other session object

Important facts
 First level cache is associated with “session” object and
  other session objects in application can not see it.

 The scope of cache objects is of session. Once session is closed,
  cached objects are gone forever.

 First level cache is enabled by default and you can not disable it.

 When we query an entity first time, it is retrieved from database
 and stored in first level cache associated with hibernate session.

 If we query same object again with same session object, it will
  be loaded from cache and no sql query will be executed.

 The loaded entity can be removed from session using evict() method.
  The next loading of this entity will again make a database call if it
  has been removed using evict() method.

 The whole session cache can be removed using clear() method.
  It will remove all the entities stored in cache
