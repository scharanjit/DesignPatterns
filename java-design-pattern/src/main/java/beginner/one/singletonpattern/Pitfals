Drawbacks of Singleton

1.) Often Overused :- Due to simplicity, everyone tries to make everything singleton.
If everything will be singleton, it will slow down the application

2.) Difficult to Unit Test :- Since singleton don't expose interface and has private
constructor, as well as private members variables ==> leads to difficult to unit test.

3.) In not careful, its not thread safe
Ppl confused static as thread safe, hence not thread safe

4.) Sometimes confused with Factory
They start making getInstance taking parameters, As soon getInstance takes argument, it is
not singleton anymore, rather a factory

5.) java.util.Calendar is NOT a Singleton
It is actually a prototype pattern because we are getting a unique instance every time we call
it's getInstance method
