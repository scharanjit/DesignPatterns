1.) Handles complex constructors
To handle lot of arguments in the constructor

2.) Large Number of parameters

3.) Immutability

Force immutability on an object

Example:- StringBuilder
DocumentBuilder
Locale.Builder


Design :-

1.) People often creates multiple constructors and it can becomes difficult to manage.
2.) The creation of multiple constructor with each parameter variation is called a telescoping constructor

The builder pattern helps us overcome this by handling that construction with an object and rather than by
parameters


==> Builder pattern is  written by static inner class

==> Negates the need for exposed setters
