Inner joins donâ€™t include non-matching rows; whereas, outer joins do include them.

Left outer join or Right outer join

An outer join is used to return results by combining rows from two
 or more tables.

 But unlike an inner join, the outer join will return every row
 from one specified table, even if the join condition fails.
