Composite key, or composite primary key, refers to cases where
more than one column is used to specify the primary key of a table.






A single attribute or a set of attributes that uniquely
identifies all attributes in a relation is super key.

A proper subset of a super key, which is also a super key is a candidate key.



Key Differences Between Super Key and Candidate Key

A single attribute or a set of attributes that can uniquely
identify all attributes of a particular relation is called Super key.

On the other hands, a super key that is a proper subset of another super key
is called candidate key.

All candidate keys are super keys but the inverse is not true.

The set of super keys is verified to find candidate keys whereas,
 the set of the candidate keys is verified to select a single primary key.

Super keys are comparatively more in number than candidate keys.
