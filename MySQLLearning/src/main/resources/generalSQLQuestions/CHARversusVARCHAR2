Both Char and Varchar2 are used for characters datatype but
varchar2 is used for character strings of variable length
whereas Char is used for strings of fixed length.

For example, char(10) can only store 10 characters and will
not be able to store a string of any other length whereas
varchar2(10) can store any length i.e 6,8,2 in this variable.
