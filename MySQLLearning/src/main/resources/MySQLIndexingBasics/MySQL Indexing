Inno DB vs MyISAM
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)



Hash Indexes are not the answer to all the slowness problems
Pros of Hash Indexes :- It creates by using hash codes. SO it does not contain
actual data
As it does not contains actual values, we cannot use hashes in
sorting, no partial matching

Multiple rows can have same hash code ==> so each hash code points
 to multiple rows ..
these are stored in linked list..again performance would be down



Hash Indexes are built in memory on top of frequently used B-Tree indexes are known
as Adaptive Hash Index

Inno DB engine has this feature, that's why they are more popular that MyIsam
